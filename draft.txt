        <h1> Day 2 - Flow and Feel (29 April 2025)</h1>

                Wow, that was actually very nice. The fact that I did it with a video guide, Vinyasa 
                Yoga with Bird, and she kept saying “take your time”, I really like it. I did not feel 
                the pressure of having to do everything within a rigid time frame. I actually did a 
                little “box” method breathing, which is like the 4-4-8, but with a 4-4-4 counting instead. 
                This helped since the theme of vinyasa is actually the link between the movement and breath. 
                The more I do the movements repeatedly in a  “Flowing” sequence, the more it is in tune with 
                the breathing. I remember the movements being done in the vinyasa sequence were first taught 
                by Sir Czy. With the Vinyasa sequence introduced, the routines were put together as if a puzzle 
                was completed in a full, smooth routine.

        <h1> Day 3 - Walk with Awareness (30 April 2025)</h1>
        <div id="description">

                After an afternoon run, I went for a 15-minute walk to cooldown. Although I have been walking around the campus, 
                I realized I have not been into some parts around the academic oval. I decided to walk using the “scenic route” 
                along the Washington Sycip Garden of Native Trees. I found this relaxing. Instead of walking along the academic oval, 
                I decided to walk along the park, along the University Amphitheater, and to the Portia Sanctuary. 
                I focused on the scene around and reflected on the different activities the Academic oval caters simultaneously. 
                It went dark quickly and I got to see the university with lights and still so many people going for running, 
                walking, cycling - well, just about everything. I was walking with my running shoes but I took the time to be 
                conscious about my breathing and the steps.

        <h1> Day 4 - Catch-up and Move (1 May 2025)</h1>

                Thankfully, I do not have a lot of backlogs, so I am taking this time to organize my output. Reflecting on my 
                movement improvements, I am amazed. Everytime someone asks me: “what PE class are you taking?” I would answer 
                Mobility and Flexibility with pride. Naturally, they would ask what we do and so I say we do headstands in class 
                and given I am in an appropriate attire, I would always give them a demo. During the first meeting, I also shared 
                about unlocking movements that have been “lost” while we’re taught not to do “awkward” sitting, but then now, 
                I get to revisit them in warmups, mobility routines, and yoga. Additionally, I am happy to report that I have not 
                been visited by back pain for the longest time. I also shared the yoga routines with my Inang, who performs the 
                routines regularly with our cats. The results not only helped her with the back pain, but also made her appreciate 
                breathing more.
